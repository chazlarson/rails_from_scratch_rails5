# Chapter 1: Initial Commit

* To create a new app named after the current date, enter the following commands in your shell window:
```
DATE=`date +%Y_%m_%d`
rails new generic_rails_$DATE
```
* In your web browser, go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a new repository with the same name as that of this new 
Rails app.  Make it a public repository.  Stick with the default options (barebones) to avoid merge conflicts.  You will see 
instructions for making the initial push from your local machine to the GitHub repository.
* In your shell window, cd into your project's root directory and follow the instructions above for pushing the initial source 
code into the repository.
