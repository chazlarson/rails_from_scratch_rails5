# Unit 2
## Chapter 4: Reset

* Begin following the steps in Unit 1 Chapter 3 for resetting your development environment and downloading the source code.
* After you have downloaded the source code, go to the first tmux screen, cd into the root directory of your project, and enter the command "sh all.sh; sh server.sh".  (Remember that the test_code.sh script and tools like RuboCop and Rails Best Practices were not yet in place back in Unit 1 Chapter 3.)
* Follow the steps needed to restore your ability to successfully use the "git commit" command.
* Follow the steps in the heroku.sh script for restoring your ability to push to Heroku again.  Follow its steps to configure your local development environment and set the name of your Heroku repository.  You should be able to push to Heroku again by entering the command "sh heroku.sh".
