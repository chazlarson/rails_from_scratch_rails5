# Unit 4: Continous Integration Badges

* In Unit 4, you will add continuous integration badges that will provide at-a-glance information on the status of your Rails app.  The build environments of your continuous integration environments function as staging environments, and having everything working as expected in these environments is a safeguard against the dependency mismanagement problem.
* Having continuous integration badges in your open source project showing good results is a signal to prospective contributors and users of your project that you know what you're doing and are committed to quality.
* To save time, you will add all of the badges at once near the end of this unit.  Most of the chapters in this unit will consist of setting up the continous integration environments.
