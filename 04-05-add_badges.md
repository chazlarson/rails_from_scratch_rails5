Welcome to the Generic App Template!
This is the template created by following the 
[Rails From Scratch] (https://github.com/jhsu802701/rails_from_scratch) protocol 
and is designed to be the basic for a wide range of new Rails apps.
This template is used in the 
[GenericApp] (https://github.com/jhsu802701/generic_app)
gem for starting off a new Rails with a high-quality pre-existing app already in place.
This saves time, because it's MUCH quicker and easier to modify an existing app 
than it is to create a new one completely from scratch.
```
