# Unit 4
## Chapter 2: Gemnasium

* Gemnasium tracks the gems in your Rails app and highlights them in colors to show whether they are up-to-date, outdated, or insecure.
* Log in to the [Gemnasium] (https://www.gemnasium.com/) web site.  You'll need to create an account if you have not already done so.
* Click on "Add New Project" and add your Rails project.  If your new Rails project is not among the list, click on the Refresh button.
* Select your project, and then press the Submit button at the bottom of the page.
* Enter your project to see the full results.  The Settings tab gives you access to the status badge.
